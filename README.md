# PDFPOC
Build in Dot Net Framework 4.6.1 and MVC5
Used Dependency Injection and Autofac Container
Used ItextSharp library for handling PDF files
Not used Mongo DB and just shown the extracted given table from PDF on UI
Extracted contents of pdf and shown in textarea.


Assumptions:

Should not use third party paid library like Aspose, Spiral, many other that can most of the things in PDF via them
Currently just used ITextSharp to deal with PDF so some of the features mentioned might not work.
